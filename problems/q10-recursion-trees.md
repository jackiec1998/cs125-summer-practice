# Quiz 10: Recursion and Trees

Practice problems here will assess your ability to:
* Be able to name certain components and know the vocabulary for a tree.
* Be able to name the components involved to correctly implement recursion.
* Understand instances where recursion might be a better problem solving strategy compared to iteration.

A good place to run some of the code is on the [home page](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/). Some of these questions are copied from CS 199: Even More Practice (EMP) from Spring '21, source is [here](https://cs199emp.netlify.app/).

## Go to EMP Website

Didn't get to writing problems this week, so we'll be using previous term's material and practice problems located on [website](https://cs199emp.netlify.app/). Specifically these slides on [recursion](https://cs199emp.netlify.app/dist/s21/2021-04-16.html) and [trees and recursion](https://cs199emp.netlify.app/dist/s21/2021-04-20.html).
