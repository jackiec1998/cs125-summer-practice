# Quiz 11: Sorting Algorithms

Practice problems here will assess your ability to:
* Deduce the runtimes for the five sorting algorithms covered.
* Produce the worse/best cases for each sorting algorithm.
* Understand the main subroutines/components that run within these sorting algorithms, e.g. merge sort requires splitting an array on the way down, merging on the way up the recursive stack.

A good place to run some of the code is on the [home page](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/). Some of these questions are copied from CS 199: Even More Practice (EMP) from Spring '21, source is [here](https://cs199emp.netlify.app/).

## Go to EMP Website

Reusing practice problems from previous semester. Go to the [EMP website](https://cs199emp.netlify.app/), specifically these slides: [Sorting Algorithm](https://github.com/harsh183/emp-125/blob/master/slides/s21/2021-04-23.md) and [MORE Recusion, MORE Trees, and MORE Sorting](https://github.com/harsh183/emp-125/blob/master/slides/s21/2021-04-26.md).
